* BNG intro
  * show simple_egfr_orig.bngl
  * like a train
  * but sometimes we want a different vehicle
* python is the future
  * numpy + matplotlib - matlab replacement...
    * x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100); y = sin(x); plot(x,y)
      * ipython -pylab
      * reinteract - from numpy import *; from replot import *;
* pysb - translation of BNG into literal python syntax
  * allows us to integrate model itself into code - model-as-program
    * interactive debugging and interrogation
    * graphical tools ok to start, but quickly need more power
    * higher-order programming
    * apply varied calibration methods
    * develop new types of modeling - hybrid stochastic (receptor/raft)
  * uses bng itself for now, but may replace it later on

* egfr model
  * reinteract - graphical rule output
  * show positional vs. keyword args
  * sympy - generate equations via bng

* bcl2 model - higher-order programming
  1. explicit full monomer/rule defs
  2. helper functions to simplify
    * can_activate
    * dimerize
    * helpers can be model-specific or generalized in a module
